Advent of Code 2021

# Day 1
So here we are again: a new season of Advent of Code, some more horrible code, another stupid README. For the first challenge I actually wrote some Rust. No way! Probably Rust that looks more like Python or C, but Rust nonetheless. Extrapolating based on how long it took me to do this one with all the guddling about in the Rust book and API documentation, wrestling with the borrow checker, etc., I reckon I'll need about 100 hours for day 18. Sigh. Anyone want to wager how long it takes me to revert back to Python? 

# Day 2
My eyeballs are throbbing gently and the gentle tinnitus of exhaustion rings faintly in my ears. It's done. I ended up plagiarising Chris's framework for running the tests. Thanks Chris. I only meant to take a little inspiration from it, but it ended up basically the same. I didn't cheat on the answer in any way - that Rust is mine all mine (as you can probably tell from the quality). At this stage it takes about a minute to solve the problem and 3 hours struggling with the ampersands, mutability, trait bounds, etc. etc. Hopefully that balance will have reversed by Christmas. Though it's a pretty slim hope. Anyway, time for bed.
