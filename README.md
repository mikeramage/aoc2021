Advent of Code 2021

# Day 1
So here we are again: a new season of Advent of Code, some more horrible code, another stupid README. For the first challenge I actually wrote some Rust. No way! Probably Rust that looks more like Python or C, but Rust nonetheless. Extrapolating based on how long it took me to do this one with all the guddling about in the Rust book and API documentation, wrestling with the borrow checker, etc., I reckon I'll need about 100 hours for day 18. Sigh. Anyone want to wager how long it takes me to revert back to Python?
